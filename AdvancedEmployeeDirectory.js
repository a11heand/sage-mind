/* 
Filename: AdvancedEmployeeDirectory.js

Description: 
This code implements an advanced employee directory system for a company. It allows for the creation, modification, and retrieval of employee information. The system also includes various additional features such as searching employees, generating reports, and managing departments.

Note: This code is a simplified version of a real-world enterprise system and does not handle data storage or UI.

  // Method to generate a report of all employees in the directory

  // More complex methods and functionality can be added here...
}

// Sample usage of the employee directory system

// Create employees
const employee1 = new Employee(1, "John Doe", 30, "Sales");
const employee2 = new Employee(2, "Jane Smith", 25, "Marketing");
const employee3 = new Employee(3, "Michael Johnson", 35, "HR");

// Create departments
const salesDepartment = new Department("Sales");
salesDepartment.addEmployee(employee1);

const marketingDepartment = new Department("Marketing");
marketingDepartment.addEmployee(employee2);

const hrDepartment = new Department("HR");
hrDepartment.addEmployee(employee3);

// Create directory
const employeeDirectory = new EmployeeDirectory();
employeeDirectory.addDepartment(salesDepartment);
employeeDirectory.addDepartment(marketingDepartment);
employeeDirectory.addDepartment(hrDepartment);

// Retrieve employees in the Sales department
const salesEmployees = salesDepartment.getEmployees();
console.log("Sales Department Employees:");
salesEmployees.forEach((emp) => console.log(emp.getDetails()));

// Remove an employee from the Sales department
salesDepartment.removeEmployee(1);

// Retrieve updated employees in the Sales department
const updatedSalesEmployees = salesDepartment.getEmployees();
console.log("\nUpdated Sales Department Employees:");
updatedSalesEmployees.forEach((emp) => console.log(emp.getDetails()));

// Retrieve all departments in the directory
const departments = employeeDirectory.getDepartments();
console.log("\nAll Departments:");
departments.forEach((dept) => console.log(dept.name));

// Search employees in the directory
const searchCriteria = { department: "Marketing", age: 25 };
const searchResults = employeeDirectory.searchEmployees(searchCriteria);
console.log("\nSearch Results:");
searchResults.forEach((emp) => console.log(emp.getDetails()));

// Generate employee report
const employeeReport = employeeDirectory.generateReport();
console.log("\nEmployee Report:");
console.log(employeeReport);
// ... Additional functionality can be implemented beyond this point

Note: Please note that this code is a sample with limited functionality and is written for demonstration purposes. In real-world scenarios, a complete enterprise-level system would require additional error handling, input validation, and proper data storage mechanisms such as databases.
